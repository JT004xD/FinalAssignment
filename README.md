Prerequisites

    Android Studio: Ensure you have the latest version installed.
    Android SDK: Download and install the required SDK components.

Steps

    Clone the Repository:
    Bash

    git clone <JT004xD/FinalAssignment>
    
    I wasn't able to complete it due to my ssd dying out of nowhere and have forgotten to upload to github a week earlier
     ,only have attempted to get around the ui implementations for the login, dashboard, and details.
    For now only a completed segment of the README.md file.


    Use code with caution.

    Open the Project in Android Studio:
        Navigate to the cloned project directory in Android Studio.
        Click "Open an existing Android Studio project".
    Configure the Project:
        If necessary, update the build.gradle files with any specific dependencies or configurations.
        Ensure the correct Android SDK version is selected in the project structure.
    Build the Project:
        Click the "Build" menu and select "Rebuild Project".
    Run the App:
        Connect a physical Android device or create an emulator.
        Click the "Run" button in Android Studio. The app will be installed on the device and launched.

Troubleshooting

    Build Errors: Check the build output for error messages. Common issues include missing dependencies, incorrect configurations, or syntax errors.
    API Issues: Verify that the API endpoint is accessible and that you have the correct credentials.
    Device Compatibility: Ensure your device or emulator meets the minimum requirements specified in the build.gradle file.
